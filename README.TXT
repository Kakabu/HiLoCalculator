Hi all!  I created this as a school project, but it serves a double purpose of maybe helping out the Torn Community!

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  You will need to download a program that can read .jar files, like BlueJ: http://www.bluej.org/ and the accompanying JDK file reader (also found on the BlueJ website).  Then you run the file that says "Openthisfile".  (I'm using BlueJ specific instructions here) Then right click on the peach box that says HiLo.  
AUTHORS: Kakabu
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Open BlueJ (make sure you have the JDK file reader also installed)
2) Open the HighLow project file that says "Openthisfile"
3) Once the project opens right click on the peach box that says HiLo
4) Left click on the "void main"
5) The box will say BlueJ Method Call, just click ok
6) This will run the program, and you can read how to use this on the screen, but for the face cards use either j, q, k, a or J, Q, K, A....typing in Ace or the like won't work
7) For those that understand, this program as an infinite loop (meaning the program won't end) unless you hit the X letter key in between high low rounds, you hit Cntl+Shift+R, or you right click on the little moving "candy cane" icon at the bottom left corner of the Blue J HiLowCalculator window...or you can open task manager and kill the program :)  
8) I know this is complicated for the audience it's intended for, but this does open and it does work!
9) Please visit the Torn forum post for questions and answers!
